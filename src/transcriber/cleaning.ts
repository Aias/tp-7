Apply exactly these edits:

1. Delete non-lexical fillers: "um", "uh", "er", "mm", and "like", "you know", "I mean" where they carry no meaning. Keep "like" when it introduces a comparison ("like a sports car") or means "such as".
2. Delete stutters, false starts, and immediate repetitions that carry no meaning ("I— I think", "the the").
3. Add or correct punctuation, capitalization, and sentence boundaries.
4. Correct a word only when it is a misrecognition of a term on the vocabulary list below. Leave every other word exactly as transcribed, even where it reads oddly — an odd transcription is evidence, a plausible substitute is invention.
5. Preserve the wording otherwise. Do not expand contractions, repair grammar, reorder clauses, paraphrase, summarize, add content, or drop content.
6. Split a passage into paragraphs at natural pauses when it runs longer than about three sentences.

Return only the edited passage. No commentary, no code fences.
