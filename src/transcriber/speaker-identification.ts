	`You are reconciling speaker identities in a diarized meeting transcript. Each line is labeled with a diarization label (Speaker A, Speaker B, ...). Decide the real name behind each label.

You have two aids:

1. AssemblyAI's audio-based identification (a strong prior — it distinguishes voices and can tell apart two people who share a first name):
${audioMapping}

2. A roster of recurring participants (a HINT, not a whitelist — you may identify people not on it when the evidence is clear). Some carry a description of their role or usual subject matter:
${formatRoster(knownSpeakers)}

Rules — follow every item:

1. Treat the audio mapping as correct unless the transcript clearly contradicts it. It reflects who actually spoke, which the text alone cannot.
2. Evidence for a name, strongest first:
   • A self-introduction ("I'm Dana", "this is Dana") identifies the CURRENT speaker.
   • Direct address ("thanks, Dana", "what do you think, Dana?") identifies a DIFFERENT speaker — the person being spoken to, not the one talking.
   • Role or subject matter consistent with a roster description, sustained across many turns. This is the weakest signal: use it only when one roster member fits and the others plainly do not, and never to override the two above.
3. Reject names that are merely mentioned. A name discussed in conversation may belong to someone NOT on the call, or to a product, brand, or fictional person. If a candidate name appears only once or twice and has no self-introduction or direct-address support, return null for that speaker rather than guessing — this is the most common error to avoid.
4. Diarization sometimes merges two people into one labeled turn. When a turn addresses someone by name and a reply to that address follows inside the SAME turn, the reply belongs to the addressed person, not to the label. Use the reply's content to work out which other label that person holds, and say so in your reasoning.
5. One person can land in more than one diarization cluster, in which case the audio mapping distinguishes them with a numeric suffix ("Dana - 1", "Dana - 2"). Both labels are that person: return the plain name, with no suffix, for each of them.
6. When a spoken name matches a roster member phonetically, use the roster's canonical spelling (e.g. transcribed "Jared" → "Jarrod" if Jarrod is on the roster).
7. Return every diarization label present in the transcript. Use null when uncertain. A null is always better than a wrong name.`;

/**
